HPSC Chiplet Eclipse Release Guide

USC/Information Sciences Institute


*** OVERVIEW ***

This package contains a version of the Eclipse IDE that is specifically designed for the HPSC Chiplet's High Performance Processing Subsystem (HPPS).  At the top level, this package contains the following files and directories:

1.  eclipse - Directory that contains the Eclipse executable.

2.  eclipse_installer.sh - The script that installs the SDK and sets up the Eclipse workspace prior to starting the Eclipse IDE for the first time.

3.  eclipse_workspace - Directory that contains Eclipse workspace-specific files, including the Yocto plug-in for Eclipse.

4.  poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-minimal-aarch64-toolchain-2.4.3.sh - The cross-toolchain installer.

5.  qemu_files - Directory that contains the QEMU executable (qemu-system-aarch64) as well as all necessary files for booting QEMU.

6.  README -  This file.

7.  sysroot - Directory that contains the root file system used by QEMU.

*** INSTALLATION ***

The first step is to call the eclipse_installer.sh script:

> sh eclipse_installer.sh

This will install the cross-toolchain SDK in a high-level directory called "sdk".  It will also place the appropriate files within the "eclipse-workspace" directory.  The next step will be to run the Eclipse executable:

> ./eclipse/eclipse

This will open Eclipse with the cross-toolchain SDK set to be used within the Yocto plug-in's standard profile.
